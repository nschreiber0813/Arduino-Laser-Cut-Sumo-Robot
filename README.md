# Arduino-Laser-Cut-Sumo-Robot

This is a project I am currently developing to help me win a sumo robot competition. This robot should weigh when completed under 750 grams which is perfect for the competition I am participating in since the limit is exactly that. The robot has five sensors. Two ir sensor switches to detect the edge of the arena and the arena itself. Then three ultrasound sensors on three sides of the robot to see if anything is nearby. These sensors are located on the left, right, and front of the robot. This is the robot assembly.
